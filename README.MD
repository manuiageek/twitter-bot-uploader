# Twitter Bot Uploader

This project is a Python script that allows you to upload images and post tweets automatically using the Twitter API (now known as "X"). To use this script, you will need to configure it with your own Twitter API keys and tokens.

## Requirements

- A free Twitter Developer account (X Developer account) to obtain the API keys and tokens.
- Python and the necessary libraries (`tweepy`, `pillow`, etc.).

pip install tweepy pillow

The code was written with the help of chatgpt
